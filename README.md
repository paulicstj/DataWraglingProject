# DataWraglingProject
This project focuses on analyzing Instacart's grocery delivery data. I'll work with a modified dataset that includes missing values and duplicates while preserving original distributions for faster computations. The task is to clean the data, analyze customer shopping habits, and present findings through visualizations.
